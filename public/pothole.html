<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">This Pothole app immaculates the solution to Pothole Problem for Governments.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="Problem_Description_2"></a>Problem Description</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">The state / or any government , faces Pothole problem , and there is lack of solution that provides an end to end flow between Government (who fixes the Pothole )and User (who registers the Pothole ) , The existing solution are not sufficient and they discourage user , since, they generally have the bad user experience , also the Government does not have a good solution to track and filter those and also to update the concerned authorities and users .</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Our aim of this project is to provide a solid and effective solution to the above problem.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8><a id="Solution_7"></a>Solution</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Our project provides set of two app : One App is for Civil Authority and the Other App is for User . The civil authority app , as the name suggests is used by Government and Civil Agents to track , update and filter the Potholes, while the User App is used by users / actors who reports the pothole . The detailed description about each of the app will be found in their’s respective repositories. The app also assigns a supervisor to each authority so that , they could monitor on the works of the authority.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=11 data-line-end=12><a id="Wait_theres_more__11"></a>Wait there’s more :</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">The Governments are provided by the heatmaps , that uses Google HeatMap Api , it displays the areas with most potholes , the map is brighter over the region where more potholes are detected , In this way Authorities could understand that which area suffers from more cases.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=15 data-line-end=16><a id="It_still_doesnt_stop_here__15"></a>It still doesn’t stop here :</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">Daily a batch job, scheduled by CloudWatch and runned by AWS Lambda , queries through all the potholes , and notifies the authority via email when a particular Pothole has been not fixed for more than defined number of days, and Supervisor is also notified , so that appropriate actions could be taken .</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=19 data-line-end=20><a id="Flow_19"></a>Flow</h2>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">The User uploads the Pothole , by filling fields such as image , description , location ( Or current location is taken ).</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">The image is uploaed to storage AWS S3 and other data is uploaded to database along with pointer to the image.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="26">The image is then passed to AI model (AWS Rekognition) , which assigns the score to that image based on different factors ,<br>
if that image have sufficient score (i.e.Here , score means how much confidence is there that an image is actually Pothole) , then it goes into next step<br>
or else the post is rejected , and is reflected to the user</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="28">Civil Authority operating within the location of Pothole is notified about the Pothole<br>
if there are multiple potholes reported within same vicinity , then they are merged into a single pothole , and hence are tracked together as one,</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="30">Then Civil Authority filters all the Pothole and updates the status of the Pothole , status is also reflected to the user , and is notified too .</li>
</ol>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="37">The app is hosted on AWS , and is architecutered in such a way that it could scale well , and could handle upto around millions of users.<br>
The app makes use of JWT token for authentication , and from storage to user details are all secured and are available only to authenticated / authorized users.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">The almost similar architecture applies for both the app.</p>

<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="46">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="45"><strong>User / Actor</strong> :<br>
It is the frontend application built on Android.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="49">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="48"><strong>Elastic Load Balancer</strong> :<br>
Elastic Load Balancer is in front of the Server , and it manages and spreads the traffic acrros the Server.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="52">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="51"><strong>Server</strong> :<br>
These are Node js application on the EC2 instances deployed by Elastic BeanStalk , are under autoscaling group , and hence , the scale automatically up and down based on the load .</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="55">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="54"><strong>Database</strong> :<br>
MongoDB Atlas , hosted on AWS , is used as fully managed NoSQL database, they are internally replicated and shraded across AZs.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="58">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="57"><strong>S3</strong> :<br>
It is highly reliable and scalable Storage provided by AWS , All the media files are stored in the bucket , The bucket is private and can only be accessible via CloudFront CDN , Also the CloudFront CDN , only allows access via Signed Url , so that only authenticated users have access to media files. And Signed Post is used , so that only the authenticated users could upload the media.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="58" data-line-end="61">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="58" data-line-end="60"><strong>Lambda Pothole Recognizer (AWS Lambda)</strong> :<br>
This is AWS Lambda function that gets triggered as soon as the image realted to Pothole Report is uploaded in the S3 bucket , this function assigns a score that how much confidence that the image is Pothole , to the image uploaded by the user , This function in turns calls AWS Rekognition , which is scalable API provided by AWS , to Label the image.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="64">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="63"><strong>Lambda CivilAuthoritySelection (AWS Lambda)</strong> :<br>
This is AWS Lambda function that gets triggered as soon as the previous Lambda function passes , This function finds and assigns the CivilAuthority that operates in the location where the Pothole is reported. This is then updated into database.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="64" data-line-end="67">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="64" data-line-end="66"><strong>AWS Rekognition</strong> :<br>
This is the fully managed AI API provided by the AWS , to label the images , that helps us in scoring the images to calculate Pothole confidences.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="69">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="69"><strong>CDN</strong> :<br>
The media files from AWS S3 are served via CloudFront CDN , So that users may have reliable latency , This CloudFront CDN , have access to the S3 bucket , and is accessed on via Signed URL , so that only the authentication users could view the media.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72">As you can see each component of the above architecture is higly scalable , secure and reliable , at each step JWT tokens and authentication are used to , and all the components are generally self sufficient so the arcitecture could be easily modified according to needs.</p>
